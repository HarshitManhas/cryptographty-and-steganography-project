# 🖼️ Cover Image Selection - Issue Fixed!

## ✅ Problem Resolved

The cover image selection functionality has been enhanced and is now fully working. The button is clearly visible with improved styling and better user feedback.

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced Button Visibility**: Added emoji icon `🖼️ Select Cover Image`
2. **Improved Layout**: Better positioning and wider button (width=20)
3. **Better Feedback**: Shows image capacity when selected
4. **Error Handling**: Validates image format and shows helpful messages

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Launch the GUI
```bash
python src/main.py --gui
```

### Step 2: Find the Cover Image Section
- Look for section **"2. Select Cover Image:"**
- You'll see a prominent button: `🖼️ Select Cover Image`

### Step 3: Select Your Image
1. Click the `🖼️ Select Cover Image` button
2. Browse and select an image file (PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF)
3. The selected image name and capacity will be displayed

## 🔍 Supported Image Formats

- **PNG files**: `*.png` (Recommended - lossless)
- **JPEG files**: `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`
- **BMP files**: `*.bmp`  
- **TIFF files**: `*.tiff`, `*.tif`

```

The capacity shows how much data can be hidden in that image.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If the button is not visible:
1. **Maximize the window**: The GUI might be too small
2. **Scroll down**: Look for section "2. Select Cover Image:"
3. **Test isolated**: Run `python test_cover_selection.py`

### If file dialog doesn't open:
1. **Check permissions**: Ensure you can access file system
2. **Test basic function**: Run `python gui_test.py`
3. **Try different location**: Select files from Desktop/Downloads

### If image is rejected:
- **Check format**: Only image files are supported
- **Try PNG**: PNG format is most reliable
- **Check file size**: Very small images might not work

## ✅ Verification

- ✅ GUI initializes successfully
